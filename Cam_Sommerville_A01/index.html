                        Here are some Computer Science jokes:<br>
                        - How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, It's a hardware problem.<br>
                        - Give a man a program, and frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.<br>
                        - If you put a million monkeys at a million keyboards, one of them will eventually write a Java program. The rest of them will write C# programs.

                        This is a quote from one of my favorite shows: 
                        Jim, you're 6'11", and you weigh 90 pounds. Gumby has a better body than you. 
                        Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss-ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art 
                        school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting 
                        to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a 
                        dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, your teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. 
                        Roasted. Angela, where's Angela? Well, there you are. I didn't see you behind 
                        that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and 
                        your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [starts giggling] Oscar, 
                        you're gay. Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck and you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.

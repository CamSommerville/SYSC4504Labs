        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Nintendo has made many exciting consoles, with the switch being the newest and coolest! 
            It has the ability to be palyed as a handheld console or you can use the docking station to
            play on a TV. It also has JoyCon controllers that can either be attached to the console when using handheld
            mode or can be removed when docked. The Joycons are designed in a way that you can use two together
            like a traditional controller or use them seperately for multiplayer games.
            The console has been a huge success for a wide variety of reasons. The switch appeals to older generation due to nostalgia
            and the releases of new versions of classic nintendo games like the Super Mario Bros series. It also succeeds at 
            appealing to the younger generation because most the games are created for a younger audience.
